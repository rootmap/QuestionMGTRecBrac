CodeIgniter Template Library Used for QMS
============================+++++++++++++

This template library for Codeigniter lets you build complex templates using partial views and widgets. It's built with the same method chaining support that we are seeing so often in Codeigniter so it feels familiar. This library loads a template file that uses partial views. These partial view sections are internally represented by Partial Objects managed by the template library. These objects let you modify their content in a user friendly way through method chaining.
